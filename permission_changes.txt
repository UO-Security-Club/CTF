Changed webroot (/var/www) and all subdirs and subfiles to be owned by www-data and have group www-data. Then changed all permissions to 750.
This way challanges that require getting a shell will not allow the user to read any data from th webroot (incase there's a flag or other sensitive info).
	commands used:
		chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www
		chmod -R 750 /var/www

Changed permissions and group for /bin/su. The su command is still owned by root but has group ubuntu with permissions set to 750.
This way challenges that require getting a shell will not allow users to attempt switching to other system accounts.
Additionally, 'ctf- * ' accounts are not on the sudo'ers list.
	commands used:
		chmod 750 /bin/su
		chown root:ubuntu /bin/su
